# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  title: "An event"
  content: "An event"
  event_start: <%= Time.now %>
  event_end: <%= Time.now+1 %>
  user_id: 1

two: {}
#  column: value
